# Module 2 Demonstrations

This file contains guidance for demonstrations you can use to help students understand key concepts taught in the module.

> **Tip**: You can use the hosted lab environment for any lab in this course to perform these demo's.

1. In Azure Data Studio, open the file at **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-080-Transact-SQL/master/Scripts/module02-demos.sql**
2. Connect the script to the saved **AdventureWorks** connection.
3. Select and run each query when relevant (when text is selected in the script editor, the **&#x23f5;Run** button runs only the selected text).
